# this is a sort of brainstorming document, where you can create a section for yourself using `3 x -` and then write your own name, as well as your proposition to how the arch should be.
## This can include encryption method, communication method, legal actions, moderative actions (if applicable), meshing system, etc. everything that can be related to security

**Proposition 1: Moderation for plausible deniability and prevention**  
  1.a  
    if algo flags message as illegal user will be forced to change or delete the message, no way around it  
  1.b  
    as false negatives will happen, a "send anyways" button will be added, along with a warning that this will send username, IP and message unencrypted to our servers for manual verification by mods and potential criminal charges if deemed viable   

  Pros: gives a clear plausible deniability as we have clearly acted in good faith and even attempted to make the media as hostile towards bad actors as possible  
  cons: we will be sacrificing a neglicable amount of freedom, independency and privacy in order for this to happen + making a tamber proof client side mod system is gonna be a pain in the ass  

**Proposition 2: I2P like high bandwidth model**  
  A completely decentralised, communication based protocol and Mesh network, with a minimum of 5mb/s throughput for image and video loading, as well as vc.  
  
  pros: can't really be shut down, as we don't know where servers are  
  cons: as we don't know where the servers are, we can't intelligently load balance and say eg. "nodes in the middle east should have a lot of unix porn on them, cause middle eastern people seem to enjoy that a lot" + this highly cryptic protocols, where it's not just parts of a message there's encryptedd but everything is encrypted and tunnalised, are quiet performance heavy and rather slow in general

**Propositions 1:  Hybrid I2P**  
  Entry nodes live on clearnet, mesh is only accessible over I2P.  
    
  Pros: Cannot be shutdown, controlled or influenced by any government. Simple to implement.  
  Cons: 5mbps is possible, but it will have high latency and the amount of bandwidth we have to share is big. (On I2P, the more bandwidth you share, the faster your connections become)
